## Usage

To run the application use your integrated terminal to type `node teams.js`. The terminal will ask a series of questions to the user in order to determine the next course of action. The application will use MySQL workbench to update and change all databases. 

## Credits 

I would like to give credit to my TA for reviewing constructor functions. I would also like to thank my classmates for helping me with this assignment. 

### Things I learned

1. One of the most important things I learned from this assignment was the use of classes instead of constructor functions. Furthermore, how to use a superclass and subclass to create new classes. 
2. Another thing that I was able to work on was Inquirer and validating user inputs. 
3. Jest.
